"# ESE546ProjectRAM" 

RAM kausik folder is the modified reward function. 
RAM master folder is the original paper's implementation. 

Both run for the cluttered MNIST data. 

Change Line #134 in config.py file to modify where to save your trained model. 

Run main.py in each folder.

I changed the parameters to the best one which the paper used.
